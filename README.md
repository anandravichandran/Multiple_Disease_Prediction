## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on input features like age, gender, medical history, etc. The application is built in Python using Streamlit, and you can interact with it via a simple web interface.

The diseases predicted by this project include:
- **Diabetes**
- **Heart Disease**
- **Parkinson's Disease**
- **Kidney Disease**

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for implementing machine learning models.
- **Streamlit** for building the web interface.
- **scikit-learn**, **NumPy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** for data processing and model training.
- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for any custom frontend modifications.
